And I haven't easily produced. So I'm excited to learn that from me then that over to you. Well, guess what I just tried sharing my screen.  \n",

So let me fix that real quick. And Sonia, I'm going to let you keep talking about whatever you want to talk about why I do the apologies.  \n",
       "4  No problem. It happens with updates sometimes. Right? Yeah. Of course, I didn't check. I just assumed we'd all be good to go and we're not. So see here. Has anyone done the homework or if it had any blog posts in the meantime? Matthew, great to see you. All right. We'll get started in a minute or two while we figure this out. Anyone who joined the previous session, this is better than getting zoom-bound.  "
