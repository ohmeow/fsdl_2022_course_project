       "      <td>so next we're going to talk about how to prioritize machine learning projects and so what this is going to boil down to is finding problems that are potentially high impact to work on and then trying to assess what the cost of those projects might be so to double click on that a little bit this is you know a general framework that you can think about for how to prioritize projects like nothing machine learning specific here but one way to think about project prioritization is that you want to look for things that are high impact or potentially high impact and are also relatively feasible right so those are the two axes that you might measure potential projects along and you know you might plot your projects on on this kind of two by two and then the ones that are in the upper right corner there's the ones to go and trap right so it's not necessarily an exercise you actually need to do but one way to think about picking projects is looking at what makes projects potentially high impact and what makes them feasible so i think there's no kind of silver bullet answer to finding high impact machine learning projects it depends on your use case and it's just generally hard but i do want to give you a few mental models for how to think about what types of machine learning projects might be high impact and so the four i want to talk about are where can you take advantage of cheap prediction where can you automate complicated where's their friction in your product that you might be able to automate away where can you automate complicated manual processes and then you know the the easiest one maybe is like what are other people doing so one lens to look at this problem with is through economics so there's this book called prediction machines that lays out the case that at a high level what ai enables you to do is it reduces the cost of prediction right so you know where a certain type of prediction might have required like an expert to spend their time to make this prediction you know machine learning allows you to like basically automate that expert into a system that you can run very cheaply and so prediction is essential for decision making and that means that if you have really cheap prediction then predictions give me a lot more places even for problems where it's too expensive before right like most people couldn't like hire a private driver before and so the implication of this if you like take this lens to project selection is to look for projects where cheap prediction could have a huge business impact right so it's a mental rule that you can think that you can think about when you're looking for high priority projects another lens i think is worth looking at is thinking about it from the lens of like what does your product actually need and so this is from an article by spotify which i think of this kind of being like one of the best machine learning driven products and i'll i'll link to this article in a few slides but the thesis that they lay out is that you should really be thinking about machine learning projects from a product perspective and you should be looking for parts of your product experience that are high friction and automating those points of high friction are exactly like where there's a lot of impact for machine learning to to make your business better a third heuristic that you might use is you know in addition to thinking about like the abstract economics of what ai enables and like what could make your product better maybe we should just think about like what is machine learning actually good at like where you know what what are the nails that this that this hammer can actually hit and so for this i like this this software 2.0 blog post by andre kurpathi and you know i think he sums it up nicely in a tweet which is uh gradient descent can write better code than you it's very nice to apologize for for insulting my code like that but to dive into this a little bit more the case that andre lays on this blog post is that what he frames as software 1.0 is kind of what most of us would think of as software right so traditional programs that have explicit instructions that are in most cases written by a human software 2.0 is a different programming paradigm where humans instead of writing code specify goals and then an algorithm that searches for a program that solves those goals and instead of working with code software 2.0 you know programmers instead work with data sets and those data sets get compiled into programs via optimization and you might ask like why do this right and and the answer at least according to andre is that it just works better you know gradient descent can write better code than you but in addition to that it's it's also more general in some sense because we can teach computers to do things that we can't easily articulate as rules ourselves and there are also computational advantages so if if instead of having like all these complicated control flows in our programs they're all just matrix multiplications that we can design better hardware to to suit those types of computations better and so you know putting on our project selection hat here the the implication of this mental model is that you should look for places in your product where or you know the whatever you're working on where there'&lt;/s&gt;</td>\n",
