## What have we done so far?

Let’s look at the dataset, ML library, API, and web application we
created for our prototype system …

### Dataset

Since we had to train summarization models and topic segmentation
models, we manually created our dataset from a bunch of youtube videos
ranging from videos from fastai lessons, FSDL lesson to random videos
teaching something.

### ML library: course_copilot

We leveraged nbdev framework to create a python package which acted as
our framework for Model training and model serving. We integrated Wandb
for experiment tracking and fine tuning models with sweeps. We created
Model trainers for task of topic segmentation and summarization. The
timing of our project coincided with release whisper which we used for
creating transcription of youtube video URL you are passing. This helps
to provide the required data for creating topic segments and summaries.

### Backend API

For the backend, we used FastAPI for creating APIs. Our API is
leveraging dagster as the workflow engine to create tasks for running
inference jobs from creating transcripts of video with whisper, running
topic segmentation and running the summarization models.

### Web Application

We created our front-end web application using Vue3 and Quasar. It is
deployed to github pages from our repo.

## Future Plans

- Improve quality of training data
- Allow users to save their corrected headlines and summaries
- Add ability for users to update topic spans
- Implement data flywheel
- Implement chapter marker and quarto export features
- Add authentication/authorization

## Install

``` sh
pip install course_copilot
```

## Setting up your development environment

Please take some time reading up on nbdev … how it works,
[directives](https://nbdev.fast.ai/explanations/directives.html), etc…
by checking out [the
walk-thrus](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html) and
[tutorials](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/) on the nbdev
[website](https://nbdev.fast.ai/)

## Step 1: Create conda environment

After cloning the repo, create a conda environment. This will install
nbdev alongside other libraries likely required for this project.

`mamba env create -f environment.yml`

## Step 2: Install Quarto:

`nbdev_install_quarto`

## Step 3: Install hooks

`nbdev_install_hooks`

## Step 4: Add pre-commit hooks (optional)

If using VSCode, you can install pre-commit hooks “to catch and fix
uncleaned and unexported notebooks” before pushing to get. See the
instructions in the nbdev documentation if you want to use this feature.
https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/pre_commit.html

## Step 5: Install our library

`pip install -e '.[dev]'`
